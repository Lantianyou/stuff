Product Ideas: TBD

Developer tools we might use in the future:

- PlanetScale, database
- Vercel, front end deployment
- LangChain, AI (LLM) integration
- Next.js, world class front end Web App
- Stripe, oversea payment

Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our engineering capability, we 
could have a chance to explore the cutting-edge engineer paractice, having first-hand 
experience on mordern App development:

- Architecture design: deployment platform, performance monitor, service communication, etc.
- Tech stack choice: programming language, dependencies, etc
- Product development life cycle: layout design, business logic, and features

We believe, as the disruption brought by WFH and AI and headwind from marco economic 
environment. The traditional software engineer career ladder is coming to an end.
To become a survior in the future, it is crucially important to demonstrate our 
capabilities in adapting to the new world.
